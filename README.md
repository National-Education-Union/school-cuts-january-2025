# Can Schools Cover Their Costs?

The government have admitted that most schools will not be able to cover the cost of staff pay rises next year[^1]. 
We calculate that schools’ costs for 2025-26 will rise by 3.4%. Mainstream school funding will increase by just 2.2%. 76% of primary schools will not have a sufficient increase in funding to cover their costs and 94% of secondary schools. The government need to increase school funding by £700m to fully fund staff pay awards next year.

## Core School Funding
School funding is known for being remarkably complicated as it is composed of so many different grants that come and go, for instance, the COVID recovery premium that was withdrawn in summer 2024. We look at core schools funding to fund education for pupils aged 5 to 16 in mainstream schools.
In the financial year 2024-25 this was composed of the following elements:
* Schools’ Block funding
*	Pupil Premium 
*	Core Schools Budget Grant
*	Teachers' Employer Pension Contributions Grant
*	Teachers’ Pay Additional Grant

In 2025-26, this is being simplified to:
*	Schools’ Block funding
*	Pupil Premium 
The other grants were supplements to the Schools’ Block and so they are being rolled up into Schools’ Block funding.

## Schools’ Block funding
Schools’ Block funding provides schools with 94% of their core school funding. Schools’ Block funding is only published in retrospect; however, the indicative National Funding Formula (NFF) allocations for 2024-25 and 2025-26 have been published. Schools’ Block allocations are very close to the indicative NFF values. We have used the Impact of schools NFF 2025-26[^2] as a proxy for the Schools’ Block allocations for 2024-25 and 2025-26. Conveniently the government have rolled the Core Schools Budget Grant, Teachers’ Pay Additional Grant and the Teachers' Employer Pension Contributions Grant into the 2024-25 baseline. This baseline will rise by 2.2% in 2025-26.
 
## Pupil Premium
The Pupil Premium provides additional funding for pupils who have received free school meals at some point in the last 6 years (FSM6). The funding rates have yet to be published. We have assumed the rates will increase by 2.4% slightly more than the increase in the NFF rates - £1,515 for primary FSM6 pupils and £1,075 for secondary FSM6 pupils[^3]. 
We have taken the proportion of schools’ FSM6 pupils and calculated the indicative number of eligible pupils and added this to the indicative NFF allocations to calculate schools’ total core funding allocations.

## Falling Pupil Rolls
The number of primary and secondary pupils fell this year for the first time. This October’s school census shows that the number of pupils declined by 44,388 pupils. 
|Year|Primary|Secondary|Total|Change|
|----|-------|---------|-----|------|
|2023-24|4,411,051|3,156,877|7,567,928| | |		
|2024-25|4,362,784|3,160,757|7,523,541|-44,388|-0.6%|

The decline in pupil numbers is concentrated in primary schools. There is also a significant amount of regional variation. London schools are the worst hit of the 12 local authorities with a fall in roll of 2% or more, 10 of them are in London. The LAs with the biggest falls are: Camden, Lambeth, Islington, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hackney, Isle of Wight, Rutland, Haringey, Southwark, Wandsworth, Westminster, and Newham.
School funding for 2025-26 is set by the pupil numbers for 2024-25. So, although the per pupil funding rate is set to rise by 2.2%, actual funding will increase by 1.6%. In 24 LAs funding will fall, which make schools closures inevitable in these areas and probably significantly more widely. 

## Schools’ Costs
Schools’ costs are composed of three distinct categories: teachers’ pay, non-teaching staff pay and non-staff costs. Teachers’ pay accounts for 52% of school expenditure, non-teaching staff pay for 30% and non-staff costs account for 18%[^4].

## Teachers’ Pay
Teachers’ pay rises are made for the academic year, but school funding covers the financial year. To calculate the average increase in teaching staff costs for 2025-26, we take 5 months of the increase for 2024-25 and 7 months for 2025-26.
In 2024-25, teachers received a pay rise of 5.5% (April 2025 to August 2025). In addition, there was a little pay drift that increased average costs by 0.2%[^5]. Combining this with a pay award of 2.8% for academic year 2025-26 (September 2025 to March 2026), gives an average pay rise of 4% for the financial year 2025-26 (April 2025 to March 2026)[^6]. 

## Non-teaching staff
The government intend to increase all public sector workers pay by 2.8% and so we assume this will also apply to non-teaching staff.

## Non-staff costs
We assume that non-staff costs will rise in line inflation and we have used the GDP Deflator, which the Office for Budgetary Responsibility predict will rise by 2.4%.

## Overall costs
When these costs are combined, we estimate that schools’ costs will increase by 3.4% in 2025-26.

|Category of expenditure|Cost increase by category|Category Weighting|Total|
|-----------|--------------------------------|-----------------|------|
|Teaching staff|4.0%|52%|2.1%|
|Non-teaching staff|2.8%|30%|0.8%|
|Non-staff costs|2.1%|18%|0.4%|
|Schools' Costs Per Pupil|||3.4%*|

_*Schools’ Costs to 3.4% due to rounding._

## School Funding Increases in 2025-26
We found that for 76% of primary schools and 94% of secondary schools their increase in per-pupil funding compared to last year’s baseline is less than 3.4%, so they will not receive a sufficient funding increase to cover their costs.
While a lower proportion of primary schools face cuts to their real terms per pupil funding, many primary schools have the additional difficulty of falling rolls and it is likely that given the lack of financial support many primary schools will close.
To fully fund pay awards for teachers and support staff teaching primary and secondary pupils aged from 5 to 16 requires an additional £580m. To cover the cost of pay awards for staff teaching primary pupils under 5, secondary pupils aged over 16 and pupils at special schools costs an additional £120m. Consequently, to fully fund the pay awards requires an additional £700m.
 
## Variation by local authority
There is remarkably little variation in funding between LAs. All LAs face real cuts. The worst hit LA, Hackney, faces cuts of 1.8% per pupil and the LA that has fared the best, Stockport, faces 0.5% per pupil.

## Long run trends in core mainstream school funding
This chart shows per pupil funding indexed against schools’ costs. We have assumed that the Pupil Premium will increase by 2.4%, slightly more than the rise in the NFF.
It is also worth noting that school funding will be at its lowest rate since at least 2010.

## Current financial position of schools
After 14 years of austerity, the majority of schools are currently not able to absorb increased costs. Class sizes have increased markedly over the period – we have the highest primary class sizes in Europe[^7], the highest secondary class sizes on record and more than a million pupils are taught in classes of more than 30[^8].
In December 2024, the government published the accounts of local authority maintained schools for the financial year 2023-24[^9]. This showed that 1 in 7 schools are currently in deficit. This is an increase on the year before and the highest rate since at least 2010.
In November, the government published a report into the financial position of mainstream schools[^10]. They found that just 3% of primary schools and 6% of secondary describe themselves as “financially secure”[^11].

The report found that schools responding to financial pressure do so by reducing additional support, spending less on curriculum resources, cutting back on school trips, reducing enrichment activities, and cutting the number of specialist teachers. These cuts affect the quality of education provided and run directly counter to the government’s stated aims for education.

In addition, schools have had to make up for cuts in local authority services. The report[^12] finds that:
> A reduction in support from outside multi-agency social care and specialist support services for pupils experiencing social, emotional and mental health needs (SEMH) meant some schools reported supplementing these costs from other parts of their school budget.
